    "1. Ramesh’s basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of  basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to  calculate his gross salary. \n",
    "2. The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a program  to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters. \n",
    "3. If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the  keyboard, find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student.  Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is  100. \n",
    "4. Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard. Write a  program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees. \n",
    "5. The length & breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the  keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area & perimeter of the rectangle, and the  area & circumference of the circle. \n",
    "6. Two numbers are input through the keyboard into two locations C and D. Write a  program to interchange the contents of C and D. \n",
    "7. If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the  number. \n",
    "8. If a four-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to obtain the sum of  the first and last digit of this number. \n",
    "9. In a town, the percentage of men is 52. The percentage of total literacy is 48. If total  percentage of literate men is 35 of the total population, write a program to find the total  number of illiterate men and women if the population of the town is 80,000. \n",
    "10. A cashier has currency notes of denominations 10, 50 and 100. If the amount to be  withdrawn is input through the keyboard in hundreds, find the total number of currency  notes of each denomination the cashier will have to give to the withdrawer.\n"
