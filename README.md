Full Stack  Data Science


Want to become a data scientist? These below-mentioned skills will help you to get into this field:

 - Programming Languages: You need to be proficient in programming languages like Python 

 - Machine Learning and Deep Learning: You need to have a good knowledge of machine learning and deep learning techniques. These techniques help you make quick decisions with predictive models.
 
 - Statistics and Maths: You should have a good understanding of statistics and maths to perform operations efficiently. Concepts such as regression, probability, linear algebra, etc. are some of the commonly used ones in data science.
   
 - Data Wrangling and Database Management: For database management, you should have knowledge of SQL, MySQL, etc which help you to manage data efficiently. Data Wrangling helps you to clean and preprocess data before analysis to have quality data.

Structured approach for learning Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analysis (DA), and Deep Learning (DL) as per my view.


PART-1/A: Understanding Concepts & Logic

1. Gain a solid understanding of fundamental concepts and logic.
2. Develop problem-solving skills.
3. Enhance communication and presentation skills.
4. Practice solving problems on paper to reinforce understanding.

PART-2/B: Learning Programming Language

1. Learn the syntax and basics of a programming language.
2. Avoid relying solely on the web or ChatGPT; actively write code and learn through practice.
3. Develop the ability to convert problems into step-by-step solutions.
4. Expand programming skills progressively.

PART-3/C: Showcasing Knowledge and Experience

1. Showcase your knowledge, exposure, and skills.
2. Work on practical projects to gain hands-on experience.
3. Explore how acquired skills can be applied to solve real-world business problems.
4. Consider how to monetize your skills and manage associated risks.
