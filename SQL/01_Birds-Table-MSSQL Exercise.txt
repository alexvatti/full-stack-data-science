1. Create SQL Table - "BirdDetails"

CREATE TABLE BirdDetails (
    bird_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    bird_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age FLOAT,
    visits INT,
    priority VARCHAR(3)
);

INSERT INTO BirdDetails (bird_name, age, visits, priority) VALUES
    ('Cranes', 3.5, 2, 'yes'),
    ('Cranes', 4, 4, 'yes'),
    ('plovers', 1.5, 3, 'no'),
    ('spoonbills', NULL, 4, 'yes'), -- assuming np.nan is equivalent to NULL in SQL
    ('spoonbills', 6, 3, 'no'),
    ('Cranes', 3, 4, 'no'),
    ('plovers', 5.5, 2, 'no'),
    ('Cranes', NULL, 2, 'yes'), -- assuming np.nan is equivalent to NULL in SQL
    ('spoonbills', 8, 3, 'no'),
    ('spoonbills', 4, 2, 'no');


2. Print all the rows with only 'birds' and 'age' columns from the dataframe
SELECT bird_name , age  FROM BirdDetails;


3. select the rows where the number of visits is less than 4
SELECT *  FROM BirdDetails
WHERE visits < 4;

4. select the rows with columns ['birds', 'visits'] where the age is missing i.e NaN
SELECT bird_name , visits FROM BirdDetails
WHERE age is NULL;


5. Select the rows where the birds is a Cranes and the age is less than 4
SELECT *  FROM BirdDetails
WHERE bird_name='Cranes' and age <4;


6. Select the rows the age is between 2 and 4(inclusive)
SELECT * From BirdDetails
WHERE age >=2 and age <=4; 


7. Find the total number of visits of the bird Cranes
SELECT SUM(Visits) From BirdDetails
WHERE bird_name='Cranes';


8. Calculate the mean age for each different birds in dataframe.
SELECT bird_name, avg(age) From BirdDetails
GROUP BY bird_name;

9. Find the number of each type of birds in dataframe (Counts)
SELECT bird_name,COUNT(bird_name) FROM BirdDetails
GROUP BY bird_name;



10. Sort dataframe (birds) first by the values in the 'age' in decending order, then by the value in the 'visits' column in ascending order.
SELECT * FROM BirdDetails
ORDER BY age DESC,  visits ASC;



11.Replace the priority column values with'yes' should be 1 and 'no' should be 0


12. In the 'birds' column, change the 'Cranes' entries to 'trumpeters'.
UPDATE BirdDetails
SET bird_name='trumpeters'
WHERE bird_name='Cranes'
